# ESP-Web-Tools-Tutorial
A guide for setting up flashing your ESP projects directly from your browser

[ESP-Web-Tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/) allows your to flash your ESP directly from your browser using [Web Serial API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API). This repo will provide the instructions needed to get this up and running.

You should note that the Web Serial API has some requirements:

- [Limited browser support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Serial) - Basically just Chrome and Edge.
- Website requires https - For this example we will use github pages to host the site, which supports https and is free.


## Help support what I do!

I have put a lot of effort into creating Arduino libraries that I hope people can make use of. [If you enjoy my work, please consider becoming a Github sponsor!](https://github.com/sponsors/witnessmenow/)
